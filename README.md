## Project Description

*A clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engage the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?*

With our project, we aim to make Tri-co more accessible to everyone. To do that, we designed a Trico-map (currently Havermap) to let students query for places on campuses based on their needs and help them navigate there. We want to prevents Trico students and staffs from getting lost in the campus and facilitate the cooperation between Tri-Co. The current Trico-map allows searching by nicknames of the buildings and the buildings’ functions (which buildings can be used for meeting places, have vending machines, etc.). This feature is completely offline. The app also comes with a navigation system aim towards freshmen, students from other schools and anyone who is unfamiliar with the campuses. We hope the app will allow people to be able to gain access to campus resources, and aid them in their daily lives.
 
## Prototype Summary

*Describe the basic functionality of your prototype. What are the features you were able to implement? What features would you like to implement?*
Basic functionality: search buildings through their name (including nickname) and the buildings’ usages. For example, searching “Nerd House” in Haverford will tell you what you can do there, or information like its real name “Yarnall Hall”. Searching for “Vending” will all the buildings with vending machines. The app also comes with a basic map for you to find where the buildings are.
Future implementation: Create a voting system so students can add their own tags to buildings to improve the searching system. Expand the map to all of Tri-co. Improve the map markers so it’s easier for students to navigate, possibly offline usage. Implement an in-app map navigation from the student’s current position.

## Next Steps

*What do you need to do next to turn this prototype into a working solution?*
Future feature: 
A voting system which allows users to vote on the tags to improve the searching algorithm. This system also allows users to add new tag after the permission of the admins.
Add schedule of certain building, include but not limited to DC, Library and swimming pool. 
Estimating travel time to to places on campuses. Improve map markers. Potentially making it offline.
Key places in the buildings, such as department locations or things like washrooms and water fountains.
Noting the entrances for buildings. Such as Founder Hall in Haverford has only one entrance that can be used to go to the Japanese Department.
Improve the searching algorithm in term of being able to make guesses based on typos or searching through synonyms.
